chopper
=======

I made a thing. Unfortunately it didn't get out of the prototyping stage. The idea was that you'd be a rescue chopper in a city where a disaster has occurred, the objective of the game being to save as many people as possible. But! the more people you save the more difficult it is to pilot your chopper.

I quite liked the idea so I may come back to it at some stage. Below's a link to the game play demo. Arrows for movement. Touch the person to pick them up with either the chopper or the last link in the human chain.
